# The Jasmine Dragon

The Jasmine Dragon is an informative tea web application inspired by the Nickelodeon cartoon **Avatar The Last Airbender**. Users will find information about the fictional establishment and the teas that are offered on The Jasmine Dragon's menu. They will be able to find types of tea that can support different aspects of health.  

This project was created to practice making fetch requests and display the core concepts of JavaScript that I am learning in my studies. 

## Technologies Used
### The following was used to make this web application: 

- Materialize (CSS framework)

- Vanilla Javascript

- JSON server


## Features
### What is expected: 

- Users will be able to search a tea name and receive relevant information if the tea is offered on the menu.

- Users will see a display of the popular tea on the menu in case they are unfamiliar with any tea. 

- Users will be able to click on a health benefit icon to display the names of teas that support that aspect of health.


## How To Use
### This is how the web application looks in action:

The search bar allows users to find information about tea that is offered on the menu.

The footer of the web application has click events that reveal lists of teas.
